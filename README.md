# COMP541 Project
Koc University 2020/2021 Fall COMP541 Project

This GitHub project includes all the related files with COMP541 Deep Learning Course project.

In this project, the aim is to replicate the previous study called:

> Deep learning for surface material classification using haptic and visual information

## Development
The project development is being held using the sophisticated deep learning framework called [Knet](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl)

## Baseline Model
The baseline model can be reached from this [notebook](https://github.com/vaydingul/COMP541_Project/blob/main/baseline_model/baseline.ipynb).

The baseline model includes:
* Data preprocessing
* Simple network architecture
* Short training
* Visualization of the results
* Metric calculation
